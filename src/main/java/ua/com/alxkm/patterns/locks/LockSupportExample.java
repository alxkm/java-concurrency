/**
 * Demonstrates the use of LockSupport for thread synchronization.

 * LockSupportExample Class: The main class demonstrating the use of LockSupport.
 * Task Class: A nested static class implementing Runnable, which parks its thread and waits to be unparked.
 * Constructor: Takes a Thread to unpark (for demonstration purposes).
 * run() Method: Parks the thread using LockSupport.park() and waits to be unparked.
 * main() Method:
 * mainThread: The reference to the current (main) thread.
 * taskThread: A new thread running an instance of Task that parks itself.
 * Thread.sleep(1000): Simulates some work in the main thread before unparking the taskThread.
 * LockSupport.unpark(taskThread): Unparks the taskThread, allowing it to continue execution.
