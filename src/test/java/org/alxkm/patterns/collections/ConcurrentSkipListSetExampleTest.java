     * This test method verifies the behavior of the ConcurrentSkipListSetExample class, which demonstrates
     * the usage of the ConcurrentSkipListSet class for concurrent access. It creates 10 threads, each of
     * which adds an element to the ConcurrentSkipListSet instance concurrently. After all threads have added
     * their elements, the test checks that each element added by the threads is present in the set. Then,
     * the test removes each element added by the threads and verifies that the set does not contain any of
     * these elements. This test ensures that the ConcurrentSkipListSet provides safe and consistent access
     * for concurrent operations without the need for explicit synchronization.
