     * This test method verifies the behavior of the MonitorObject class, which demonstrates

     * environment. It creates two threads, t1 and t2, both of which invoke the increment method
     * of the MonitorObject instance concurrently. The test ensures that both threads complete their
     * increments before checking the final count value. The expected count value after both threads
     * complete their increments is 2, indicating that the increment operation is properly synchronized
     * and the shared resource (count) is updated correctly by multiple threads.
